## Main Ref

![[refs/dawnwhisker/main-ref.jpeg|A character reference for the hero DawnWhisker]]

DawnWhisker is a cheerful, over-the-top hero who tries his very best to be the coolest hero the world has ever seen!
## Info

- **Age**: 26
- **Pronouns**: he/him
- **Orientation**: Bisexual
- **Strengths**: Tenacious, Resilient, Over-the-top cheerful
- **Weaknesses**: Easily overpowered, Rushes in without thinking, Kind of annoying

## Powers

His power is portal creation, but in a limited capacity (which I have comms occasionaly break, but rule of cool y'know xD)

He's able to spend a few seconds to draw a portal frame, but once that frame is down somewhere he's able to instantly connect any two frames he can think of by pushing his hands together. So pretty much -- thrives in situations he's able to set up a bunch of portals, but struggles if he is taken off guard (cuz no portals are set up). His powers can be used in some fun ways (like, he can put a portal on a large flat surface and move it around during a fight to like catch projectiles and send them back at his opponent). Also has some smaller super strength, durability, and recovery powers but that's mostly so I can justify him getting into fights all the time and still being mostly fine haha

## Role

He acts as a scout for the hero agency he works for. He's often using his portals to patrol an area. He is a first responder that can get a read on what type of villain is there, and get the right heroes on the scen as quickly as possible.

## Personality

He is over-the-top energetic, extremely eager to be a hero and really wants to look cool despite his frequent clumsiness. This means he's easily tricked and will try to do the "cool hero" thing without fully thinking through it. Also means he's able to get really beat up and he'll keep on getting up and trying to fight back even if he's clearly outmatched.
