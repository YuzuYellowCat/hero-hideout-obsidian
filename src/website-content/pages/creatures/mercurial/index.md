Mercurial is an occult themed goat supervillain who likes to find ways to cause chaos and frustrate and dominate hero do-gooders.

## Info

- **Age**: 32
- **Pronouns**: he/him
- **Orientation**: Bisexual
- **Strengths**: Tricky, Defensive, Manipulative
- **Weaknesses**: Raw Strength can overpower him, he struggles when things become more than a 1v1

## Powers

He has 3 core powers:

**Mind Reading**: Basically, like, pick any object in the room and focus on looking at it. If he does that to a living creature, he is able to read their mind.

**Holographic Projection**: He has the ability to create any non-solid projection within a large radius of him. Projections can't by physical in any way so can't do damage, so he mostly uses them along with mind reading to mess with a hero as much as possible and confuse them.

**Summoning Circle**: A ring of 6 tentacles appear at his feet that he can control, each about 8ft in length -- pretty short range but helpful in attacking and restraining a hero if he can get close enough.

During fights, he can analyze the thoughts of anyone who he is fighting to anticipate their plans, and then use his projection skills to foil those plans or confuse the hero as much as possible. Then, in close range, he can use his summoning circle ability to assist with fighting, along with anticipate how they want to attack which means he can dodge any traps or incoming attacks

## Motivations

He finds the concepts of heroes annoying and pointless, and he's out to prove it and have fun in the process. His goal in a fight is to both mess with any heroes both physically and mentally — meaning if he catches any enjoyment being had out of defeat thru mind reading, he sure as hell is going to exploit that and have fun messing with the hero.

## Personality

He's definitely the type of villain who enjoys being over-the-top evil, and loves the power of taking down the heroes and what they represent. He's got a bit of a screw loose, and just wants to cause pain and/or humiliation to whoever he faces.
